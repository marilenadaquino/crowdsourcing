    ns2:description "The IUMA was started in 1993 by three students at the University of California at Santa Cruz: Jeff Patterson, Jon Luini and Rob Lord. The three men worked together to create an online music archive that would help musicians and bands who weren't signed by a major label. The site allowed these unsigned artists to upload files and send them to fans. The site also enabled the artists the opportunity to talk with their fans. The IUMA was at first part of the Usenet newsgroups. IUMA eventually became part of eMusic and was shut down in 2006. Parts of the collection are now preserved by the Internet Archive." ;
